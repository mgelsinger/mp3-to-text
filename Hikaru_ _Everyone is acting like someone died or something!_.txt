Hey, Karo, how are you feeling today? Same as always. Everyone's acting like someone died or something. Yeah, you show up, you try to play good chess. If you don't play good moves, bad things tend to happen. So yesterday was one day, but today is a new day, and we'll see how it goes. But I think everybody kind of shows up like that because a lot of chess players do react quite strongly and it seems to last for a while. You've gotten more experience, you've also gotten better at handling that chess goes up and down from day to day. Well, I think there's one very important thing that players of my generation. So I'd say players like myself or maybe Fabiano and Magus are only a couple years younger than me, which is that I would say when we're younger, you would have a lot more of what I would call clean games, meaning that you would have a game that was very one way. There's of course the famous Magus interview with Marie Sashley, whichever one is aware of. So I think because of that, the general view is that, you know, if you don't play clean game or you make mistakes, it's a big, big issue. But I think as I started to realize, um, especially as I got older, the players are also good now that they're never going to be these smooth games that are one way, you know, all the way and you know mistakes are going to happen. So it was unfortunate what happened yesterday, but you know, it's a long term. There are many more games. What have you planned for the opening against White today? Uh, well, I guess you guys will see. You look forward to it. Thank you. Okay. I tried. Yeah.
